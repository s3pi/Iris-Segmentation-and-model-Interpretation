# Iris_Segmentation
This problem will introduce you to understand pixel-wise image segmentation. The image segmentation problem is a core vision problem with a longstanding history of research. Historically, this problem has been studied in the unsupervised setting as a clustering problem: given an image, produce a pixelwise prediction that segments the image into coherent clusters corresponding to objects in the image. In this case, you are expected to learn about how to segment iris area in the given eye images.
