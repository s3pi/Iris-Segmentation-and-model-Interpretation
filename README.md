# Iris_Segmentation
This problem discusses pixel-wise image segmentation and its interpretation using LRP (Layerwise Relevance Propogation: http://heatmapping.org/) algorithm. The image segmentation problem is a core vision problem with a longstanding history of research. Historically, this problem has been studied in the unsupervised setting as a clustering problem: given an image, produce a pixel wise prediction that segments the image into coherent clusters corresponding to objects in the image. We segment and explain how much is the relevance of each pixel in the decision of segmention.
